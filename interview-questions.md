# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:Git is an acronym for Global Information Tracker. It is a version control software that allows users to track changes to files. Github is the most popular online host for git repositories.

Researched answer: You cannot use github without git, but you can use git without github. While this is obvious now that I read it it never occurred to me before.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Relational operators will return a boolean. Those are the greater than/less than and comparison operators.

Researched answer: The algebraic boolean operators will also return boolean values. Those are &&, ||, and the BANG! operator.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: Every element of every javascript array has an index. These indexes start at 0 and increment by 1 as elements are added to the array. These elements are the value. Arrays can hold as values; any primitive data type, other arrays, objects, and more.

Researched answer: You can also have mixed type arrays. Meaning you can even have array values of more than one data type at a time. However the indexes will also be numbers starting from 0, incrementing by 1.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:Arrays and Strings are both collections of smaller elements. An array being made up individual values that can house all types. Strings are simply a collection of characters. Both are 0 indexed and have access to some of the same methods, such as .length.

Researched answer: Arrays are considered objects, which means they can only ever be strictly equal to themselves. This is a stark contrast the primitive data type of string.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?


Your answer:Pair programming is the process of having two people work on the same file. One programmer operates as the driver, sharing their screen and typing in the target file. The other programmer takes on the role of navigator. They simply share the mental load, assisting the driver with completion of the tasks. Driver types, Navigator researches.

Researched answer: To be successful with pair programming actually invovles a high skill level from both members. The partners must have the soft skills to collaborate effectivly and stay engaged, while also having the hard skills necessary to write effective code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function that either accepts as an argument, or returns another function. 

After some time to mull over the concept, I realized that .sort is a higher order function(I think), because it accepts a function as an argument. However, I still have no meaningful understanding of how to write my own higher order functions.

2. Jest: Jest is a tool used for testing javascript code. It allows you to write and run tests, and track what portions of your code have been tested and which haven't.

3. Objects: An object is essentially when you hold values(varialbes) and/or behaviors(methods/functions) in its own variable.

4. Method:A method in javascript, is a function that is attached to an object. 

If my understanding is correct, a method is ALWAYS a function, but a function is not always a method.

5. Classes:Classes are templates for objects. They lay out the information contained by and the behavior that the object can express.

If you want to build a car, first you must build a car factory.
